# **`Norm Micro-ORM`**

_The fastest database mapper for .NET Standard 2.1_

## Features at a Glance

### `Modern and Fast`

##### Uses [`tuples`](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net/wiki/4.-Read-extension#iterate-a-two-value-tuples-int-and-string-example), [`named tuples`](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net/wiki/4.-Read-extension#create-a-named-tuples-enumeration-and-get-the-highest-value-example), [`records`]() or [`plain old classes`](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net/wiki/5.-Query-extension#map-to-class-instances-example) - to map the SQL results from your databases.

##### Uses async enumerables and powerful [`asynchronous database streaming`](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net/wiki/8.-Asynchronous-programming#readasync-and-queryasync)

##### Fast. Very fast mapping. [`performances indistinguishable from the raw data reader`](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net#performances).

### `Trustworthy and Reliable`

##### Over 250+ automated tests for `SqlServer`, `PostgreSQL`, `SQLite`, and `MySql`.

##### [`Source links`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/sourcelink) are included in the package. That means that you can [Step Into] the source code when debugging to see exactly what it does.

### `All Databases`

##### Strictly Implemented as set of extensions - for  [`System.Data.Common.DbConnection`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.common.dbconnection?view=net-5.0) instances.

##### Works with all databases based on `common DbConnection` class, and that is pretty much `all databases.`

##### Native support for `ARRAY` databae types for database providers that have `ARRAY` support (PostgreSQL).

### `Simple, Lightweight and Easy to Use`

##### Only four extensions - [`Execute`](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net/wiki/2.-Execute-extension), [`Query`](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net/wiki/3.-Single-extension), [`Read`](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net/wiki/4.-Read-extension), and [`Single`](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net/wiki/3.-Single-extension). That's all it needs. There is no learning curve at all.

##### No need for extra configuration or any special attributes.

##### Small, and absolutely **`no dependencies whatsoever.`**

##### All public methods were thoroughly documented in documentation comments that are `available to IntelliSense` and shipped with the package.

##### User friendly [Manual](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net/wiki) available.

## Usage

### Get it on Nuget

```txt
> dotnet add package Norm.net
```

### Use in project

```csharp
using Norm;

// Start using database connection extensions. Some examples:

// Map results to record MyRecord
var records = connection.Query<MyRecord>("select id, foo, bar from my_table");

// Map results to class MyClass
var results = connection.Query<MyClass>("select id, foo, bar from my_table");

// Map single values to tuple and deconstruct to three variables
var (id, foo, bar) = connection.Single<int, string, string>("select id, foo, bar from my_table");

// Build enumerable of named tuples:
IEnumerable<(int id, string foo, string bar)> results = connection.Read<int, string, string>("select id, foo, bar from my_table");

// Asynchronously stream values directly from database
await foreach(var (id, foo, bar) in connection.ReadAsync<int, string, string>("select id, foo, bar from my_table"))
{
    //...
}
//
// etc...
//
```

## Performances

- See detailed perfomance benchmarks compared to **Dapper** at [performance tests page](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net/blob/master/PERFOMANCE-TESTS.md).

- To run [beckmark console](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net/blob/master/BenchmarksConsole/Program.cs) manually, configure local testing for [PostgreSQL unit tests project](https://github.com/vb-consulting/Norm.net/tree/master/Tests/PostgreSqlUnitTests) first. See instructions for local testing bellow.

## Testing

250 automated tests for SqlServer, PostgreSQL, SQLite and MySql

### Local testing

- Under each test project there is a `testsettings.json`. 
- Copy this file and rename it to `testsettings.local.json`. It will be ignored by git.
- Set the key `Default` to the value of your actual, local connection string.
- The key `TestDatabase` contains the name of the test database, which is created and dropped on each testing session, so be careful about that.
- Run `dotnet test`
